# recognize-text-from-a-video

This program creates a video storyboard and recognizes the text on each of the video frames.
For correct operation, you need to install tesseract, it is located here - [https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki][https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki]

To begin with, I recommend that you familiarize yourself with the program code and make your settings in the `__init __ (self)` of the main program class.
